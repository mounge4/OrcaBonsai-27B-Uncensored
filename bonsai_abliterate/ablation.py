"""Apply a refusal direction to a Prism Hadamard ternary pack at run time.

Ordinary abliteration is a permanent weight edit: every matrix that writes the residual
stream is orthogonalised against the refusal direction, ``W <- W - r (r^T W)``. That is
not possible on Bonsai 2 27B. Its weights are ternary -- the affine container stores
``scale = s`` and ``bias = -s``, so the 2-bit codes ``{0,1,2}`` decode to exactly
``{-s, 0, +s}`` -- while the orthogonalised matrix is dense and full precision. Storing
it back would mean re-quantizing to ternary, and the model's quality at 1.72 bits/weight
comes from quantization-aware training, not from the format: re-quantizing without that
training is what destroys it.

This module applies the same operator at the point of use instead:

    y <- y - alpha (y . r) r

on the output of every residual writer. That is algebraically identical to
orthogonalising the matrix which produced ``y``, but the packed weights stay
bit-identical, so **no quantization error is added at all**. It is also reversible, and
``alpha`` stays adjustable at run time -- neither of which a baked edit can offer.

Two properties of the pack matter when wiring this up:

* The Hadamard rotation is folded into the **input** dimension only
  (``hadamard.json``: ``axis=input-last-dimension``, block 1024). The vectors being
  projected are the *output* rows of the writers, and the embedding output is
  un-rotated by ``Packed`` itself. So the direction is an ordinary vector in the plain
  hidden basis and **this path needs no Hadamard handling**.
* The residual writers are ``mlp.down_proj`` (64), ``linear_attn.out_proj`` (48) and
  ``self_attn.o_proj`` (16), plus ``model.embed_tokens``: 129 modules in total. The
  architecture is 48 linear-attention and 16 full-attention layers, so wrapping only
  ``o_proj`` would miss three quarters of the attention writes.
